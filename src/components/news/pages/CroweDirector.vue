                <p>The idea of <strong>
                        ‘A Day Director‘
                    </strong> having being discussed at one of the school’s PTA meetings, was to help
                    awaken and discover the “latent” leadership quality in student. It was also aimed at creating a positive
                    and constructive competition among the students. After a thorough screening and assessment process where
                    nine (9) outstanding students were involved, <strong>Adebiyi Isreal</strong> emerged the overall winner.

                    event, said he got

                    “We don’t have
                    the power to make a governor yet, but we can make a One-Day Director”. He aslo stressed the importance
                    of the initiative which is “to identify latent leadership talents in students, enablement of a
                    constructive and positive competition as it’s required in an academic environment and to reconstruct the
                    mindset of the students to seeing the supreme importance of education”. He solicite the support of the
                    Parents and Students and told them to await more colorful and intellectual programme unfolds.</p>

                    School Director for his efforts and commitments on the School and on him, personally. In appreciation of
                    the staff’s efforts, he approved the payment of staff transportation allowance, a reasonable and
                    dignified sum. He also stated that his “leadership promises to be fair and also credible.”</p>
                <p>Awards and gifts were presented to him and he was thereafter ushered to his office where he assumed the
                    administrative duties of the day. He served in the capacity of the School Director for 24 hours.</p>
